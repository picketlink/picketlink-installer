PicketLink Installer
====================

Introduction
------------

The PicketLink Installer provides an easy way to get started with PicketLink.

It configures a JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 installation with all the necessary modules, some basic configurations and quickstarts.

Important Note: Once JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is updated with PicketLink 2.5 libraries and tools, the installer will no longer be necessary.

The installer updates the PicketLink module(which defaults to 2.1.x) in JBoss EAP 6 with the 2.5 libraries.

You don't need to change any configuration in your deployment to start using this version. The *META-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml* still looks the same:

        <jboss-deployment-structure>
          <deployment>
            <dependencies>
              <module name="org.picketlink" />
            </dependencies>
          </deployment>
        </jboss-deployment-structure>
